### Project description

In this platform, you can add, search, delete and update books and authors - a *CRUD* application. The back-end uses a  routing system and *MVC* (Model-View-Controller) architecture for generating dynamic pages.

### How to use
  
- You can search for existing authors, and if you want, you can also be adding a new one.
